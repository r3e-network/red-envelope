# Claude Code Configuration — Red Envelope

## Behavioral Rules (Always Enforced)

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER save working files, text/mds, or tests to the root folder
- ALWAYS read a file before editing it
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or .env files

## File Organization

- NEVER save to root folder — use the directories below
- Use `/src` for source code files
- Use `/tests` for test files
- Use `/docs` for documentation and markdown files
- Use `/config` for configuration files
- Use `/scripts` for utility scripts
- Use `/examples` for example code

## Project Architecture

- Follow Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Use typed interfaces for all public APIs
- Prefer TDD London School (mock-first) for new code
- Use event sourcing for state changes
- Ensure input validation at system boundaries


## Build & Test

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint
```

- ALWAYS run tests after making code changes
- ALWAYS verify build succeeds before committing

## Security Rules

- NEVER hardcode API keys, secrets, or credentials in source files
- NEVER commit .env files or any file containing secrets
- Always validate user input at system boundaries
- Always sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
